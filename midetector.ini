//All flags displayed are obtained through the LSPDFR API and RPH. The flags are NOT random.
//Due to LSPDFR setting a lot of flags by default, you can configure the chance that Speed Checker will bring the flag found up.

//You must enter a whole, round number ranging from 1 to 100.
BringUpFlagChance=15
